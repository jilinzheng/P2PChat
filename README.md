# Peer-to-Peer Chat System

## Purpose and Summary

This project was completed Spring 2024 for EC530 @ Boston University. I have implemented a Central Server meant for user discovery, but aside from that Peers (that serve as both server and clients) can connect with each other and achieve decentralized communication. It is easy to get started: simply execute the `central_server.py` and/or `peer.py` scripts, and follow the on-screen instructions. For more information, I have also included a demonstration video below.
